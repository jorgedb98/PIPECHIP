## ChIP Seq
ChIP Seq combines methodolgy of High Troughput Sequecing of DNA plus Chromatin Immuno-precipitaion technique to study potential places for Transcription Factors (TF) to bind DNA. By using PIPECHIP it may be possible to understand where the target TF bind and what structures they conform.

## Usage
For carrying the study the user migth need to create a parameters file in order to create those which they may find necessary. For further examples, please check de current parameters file in this respository <params.sh>.

## Parameters
Here we should explain each parameter from the <params.sh> file.
